# Portfolio

My modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with SvelteKit and TypeScript.

## Overview

This project is a showcase of my work as a software developer, featuring a sleek design with interactive elements. It serves as a central hub for my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Features

-   **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations and transitions using custom Svelte actions (`reveal`, `hover3D`).
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
-   **Theme System**: built-in dark mode support with a theme toggle.
-   **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display projects with filtering capabilities (planned/disabled in code) and detailed cards.
-   **About Section**: Introduction with a reveal animation.
-   **Contact Information**: Easy access to social links and contact details.
